    "This Jupyter Notebook uses hyper-parameter tuning to optimize model performance, with Logistic Regression and Decision Tree models used for classification and performance evaluated using cross-validation scoring.  Parameters were tuned using a GridSearch estimator.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach\n",
    "* Evaluations of classification performed were performed using 2 sample datasets:\n",
    "    * sklearn's Iris sample dataset, consisting of 150 sample data points for 3 varieties of iris flowers\n",
    "    * voice dataset, containing 3168 sample data points of male and female speakers\n",
    "\n",
    "* Hyper-parameter tuning was performed using a GridSearch estimator for each classification model:\n",
    "    \n",
    "* Parameters providing the best scores and associated scores were plotted\n",
    "    \n",
    "## Results\n",
    "* Refer to the Figure and Table of results provided below\n",
    "* TBD...\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- \n",
    "* The Logistic Regression classifier showed little variation between model scores with similar model parameters when scoring was performed with or without cross-validation.  The \"inflation\" of the direct score vs. cross-validation score was less than 1.6% for this classifier, and less than 0.4% with the Voice dataset.\n",
    "* For the Decision Tree classifier, model performance was scored up to 9.4% higher using the direct model score vs. a cross-validation score.\n",
    "* Additional investigation comparing (cross validation score - testing data score) vs. (training data score - testing data score) would provide a view of which scoring approach provides an estimate closest to the testing data score.\n",
